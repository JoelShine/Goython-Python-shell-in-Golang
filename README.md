# Goython
Goython - A python shell written and debugged in Golang.

Inspiration
-----------
Being a frequent user of Python, now only I started studying Golang. So I thought, it would be interesting to make a Python responsive shell, in my new language Golang. Therefore, Goython was formed.

Supportive commands and Use cases
---------------------------------
Currently, Goython only supports print statements in Python. Other functionalities would be added soon !

Your support
------------
Your support, helps me to develop my projects. If any of you know some of **"Go" Programming language**, It would be nice if you could share your thoughts. Create an issue with title **#Goython-Development** for adding commands to the program and to make a full working python shell in Golang.

Hope everyone like it ðŸ˜Š
